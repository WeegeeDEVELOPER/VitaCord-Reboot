# VitaCord Reboot
VitaCord given new life, currently WIP.

For now it is not recommended to compile from source, mainly because the source is not working properly all the time, if you want a build its best to take a look at the releases... https://github.com/WeegeeDEVELOPER/VitaCord-Reboot/releases

# Important, use an alternate account
While I can not be 100% certain of you getting banned, there always is a small chance, if you feel like trying any pre-release, please use an alternate account!
