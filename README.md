# Discord on the Vita
A continuation of VitaCord with new features and a facelift. Currently a WIP.

## Installation
Download the latest `VitaCord_Reboot.vpk` from [here](https://github.com/WeegeeDEVELOPER/VitaCord-Reboot/releases).
Install the .vpk using [VitaShell](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases/) on your Vita.


## Use an alternate account!
Currently the client is using a system which "spams" the API with requests. This is seen as API abuse and (if spotted) will result in your account being suspended. It is important to note however, that the Vita client has some counter measures against this. 

There is currently no clear evidence of accounts being suspended, however it's better to be safe than sorry, so please use an alternate account until the client is updated to use a different approach. 

**This will most likely be fixed in a future release!**

## Build
It is not currently recommended to compile from source. This is due to the source not working properly all the time. If you wish to build it then its best just to take a look at the releases...
